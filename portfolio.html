                    I was a team member for the development of an Employee Management project for the Accounting 
                    and Administration office of the government of Michoacan, Mexico. My main contributions included 
                    developing the login system, user and employee roles and permissions, the main welcome page, and 
                    two form modules for attaching employee documentation to the system. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The project was developed 
                    using Laravel and JavaScript, while my work was primarily carried out in PHP and MySQL. The team 
                    continuously evaluated my contributions and ensured that I adhered to the color scheme and typography 
                    standards of the Mexican government.

                <h2>Website prototyping for the Technological University of Morelia.</h2>

                    As an intern at my university, I developed a prototype of the university's website. I was assigned 
                    to work with the university's IT team, where I was given the design and programming requirements, 
                    such as using Python as the main programming language and Django as the framework, as well as using 
                    Adobe XD and Figma for designing the website prototype. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Throughout the project and the development of each module, a member of the university's IT development 
                    team was assigned to review and assess my contributions. Additionally, I was in contact with the Director 
                    of Gastronomy and the Director of Information Technologies to gather relevant data to include in the 
                    website prototype.
